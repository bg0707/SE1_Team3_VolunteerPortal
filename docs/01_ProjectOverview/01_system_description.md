`Project Topic: Local Nonprofit and Volunteer Portal (Team 3)`

## Short Description

Our project has as a goal to strengthen community engagement by developing a web plateform that aims at connecting the volunteer with local nonprofit organizations. More concretly, the system allows orangizations to register, post, and manage volunteer opportunities, while on the side from the volunteer, they can browse opportunities, filter these by cause or location, search by term, and apply for these oppportunities that align with their interests. To sum, our goal is to make volunteering more accesible, easy and impactful by connecting motivatd individuals with reliable local initiatives that need help and support. 

## Team Organization
Our team is committed to collaboration, strucutre and quality and to learn from this project and to take the most of it. So to fullfill this objective, we try to apply the learned concepts to the respective task, using this approach to learn how real-world software engineers plan, build, and collaborate. To achieve the collaboration part, tasks are tracked through GitHub issues, and the overall development work is managed through branches and pull requests to ensure clean version control. We have added a designated discord channel to github updates, the team has intergrated discord with GitHub so it automatically post pull reauest and pushes, such that we maintain the team informed in real time.
