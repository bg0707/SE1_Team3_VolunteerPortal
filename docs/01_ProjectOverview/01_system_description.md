# 1. Project Overview 

`Project Topic: Local Nonprofit and Volunteer Portal (Team 3)`

## Short Description

Our project has as a goal to strengthen community engagement by developing a web platform that aims at connecting the volunteer with local nonprofit organisations. More concretely, the system allows organisations to register, post, and manage volunteer opportunities, while on the side from the volunteer, they can browse opportunities, filter these by cause or location, search by term, and apply for these opportunities that align with their interests. To sum up, our goal is to make volunteering more accessible, easy and meaningful by connecting motivated individuals with reliable local initiatives that need help and support.

## Team Organization
Our team is committed to collaboration, structure and quality and to learning from this project and to making the most of it. So to fulfil this objective, we try to apply the learnt concepts to the respective task, using this approach to learn how real-world software engineers plan, build, and collaborate. To achieve the collaboration part, tasks are tracked through GitHub issues, and the overall development work is managed through branches and pull requests to ensure clean version control. We have added a designated Discord channel to GitHub updates. The team has integrated Discord with GitHub so it automatically posts pull requests and pushes, such that we keep the team informed in real time.
